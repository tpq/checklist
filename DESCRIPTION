Description: At its core, checklist is a base-R implementation of recursive feature
    elimination (RFE), a search algorithm that seeks to identify a minimal set of
    features that minimise the total loss of a fitted model. The algorithm is
    written in a generic way so that it can use any user-defined loss function
    that takes the arguments 'x' and 'y' and returns a numeric value.
    In 'checklist', we define a checklist as a linear model with integer
    coefficients. When coefficients are integers, it is feasible for a human
    to calculate predictions "by hand". When the number of features are few,
    the model is easy to interpret and thus easy to implement in practice.
